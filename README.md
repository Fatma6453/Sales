# Salary Prediction Using Linear Regression

 ## Project Overview:

## Data Cleaning & Preparation: I began by cleaning the dataset, removing irrelevant columns, and handling missing values to ensure data quality.

## Feature Engineering: I focused on relevant features such as education level and years of experience, converting categorical data into numerical values to make it suitable for modeling.

##  Model Building: Using the LinearRegression model from scikit-learn, I trained the model on an 80-20 train-test split. This allowed me to make predictions and gain insights 
into how different factors influence salary.

## Results & Insights: The model highlighted significant relationships between education, experience, and salary, reinforcing the importance of data-driven decision-making.

## Key Takeaways:

Understanding the impact of different features on salary can help organizations make informed decisions in compensation planning.
The power of linear regression lies in its simplicity and ability to provide clear, interpretable results.
