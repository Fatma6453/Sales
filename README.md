The code in the Sales Prediction.py file is a script for predicting salary using a linear regression model. Here's an overview of the key steps involved:

Imports and Setup:

Necessary libraries like numpy, pandas, LinearRegression from scikit-learn, and train_test_split for splitting data are imported.
Warnings are filtered to ignore user warnings.
Data Loading:

The script reads a CSV file named Salary Data.csv into a DataFrame using pandas.
Data Exploration:

The first few rows of the dataset are displayed using df.head().
The shape of the dataset and information about data types and non-null values are examined using df.shape() and df.info().
Data Cleaning:

The script checks for missing values and drops any rows with null values.
Feature Selection:

Irrelevant columns like Age, Gender, and Job Title are dropped.
The remaining categorical feature, Education Level, is converted into numerical form using LabelEncoder.
Splitting Data:

The dataset is split into features (x) and target (y) for training and testing.
The data is further split into training and testing sets using an 80-20 split.
Model Training:

A LinearRegression model is instantiated and trained using the training data (x_train and y_train).
Prediction:

The trained model is used to make predictions on the test data (x_test).
The script continues with further steps, likely including evaluation of the model's performance and possibly other regression algorithms to compare accuracy.
